# Archive

Archive is where your data is stored. You can upload your data or import data from the dataset page. 

When you process your data, the data must be "staged out" of archive and shipped to various computing resources. 
By default, any data generated by the App will not be archived back unless you manually request it. 

Please see [uploading data](/docs/user/started/#upload-data) page for more detail.
