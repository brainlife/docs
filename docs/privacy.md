## Applicability

This privacy notice applies only to the brainlife.io (https://brainlife.io) and explains our practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of visitor information. Visitor information collected by brainlife.io will be used only as outlined in this privacy notice.

Other units at the university may collect and use visitor information in different ways. Therefore, visitors to other university websites should review the privacy notices for the particular sites they visit. brainlife.io is not responsible for the content of other websites or for the privacy practices of websites outside the scope of this notice.

## Changes

Because Internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly, brainlife.io may make appropriate changes to this notice in the future. Any such changes will be consistent with our commitment to respecting visitor privacy, and will be clearly posted in a revised privacy notice.

## Collection and Use

### Data-objects

Brainlife.io allows you to upload your neuroimaging data and store them on public and private project. All data stored in public projects can be accessed by brainlife.io users, and data stored in private projects can be accessed by the project members and brainlife administrators. The ownership of all data uploaded, stored on brainlife.io remains with the original owner of the data along with all copyright and license attributes. The data generated within brainlife.io would belong to the project members. 

Brainlife.io allows administrators to access uploaded and generated data-objects stored in private projects when users request for troubleshooting or for investigating suspicious activities and other limited occasions. Brainlife.io is hosted on XSEDE/Jetstream inifrastructures, and on various NFS funded storage systems. Administrators of those systems may have access to the raw data stored on those resources.

Brainlife.io will not use user's data-objects to conduct any research activities unless you explicitly give permission to do so.
