## Applicability

This privacy notice applies only to the brainlife.io and explains our practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of visitor information. Visitor information collected by brainlife.io will be used only as outlined in this privacy notice.

Other units at the university may collect and use visitor information in different ways. Therefore, visitors to other university websites should review the privacy notices for the particular sites they visit. brainlife.io is not responsible for the content of other websites or for the privacy practices of websites outside the scope of this notice.

## Changes

Because Internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly, brainlife.io may make appropriate changes to this notice in the future. Any such changes will be consistent with our commitment to respecting visitor privacy, and will be clearly posted in a revised privacy notice.

## Collection and Use

### Data-objects

brainlife.io allows you to upload neuroimaging data and store them on your project. All data stored in public projects can be accessed by brainlife.io users, and data stored in private projects can be accessed by the project members. User can also choose to publish data on private project through brainlife publications.

The ownership of all data uploaded, stored on brainlife.io remains with the original owner of the data and retains all copyright and license attributes. The data generated within brainlife.io would belong to the project members. 

brainlife.io allows administrators to access uploaded and generated data-objects stored in private projects when users request for troubleshooting or for investigating suspicious activities and other limited occasions. 

### Data Security

The archive data is currently stored on [OSiRIS](https://www.osris.org/), the NSF founded distributed storage infrastructure. We are also exploring the use of [OSN](https://www.openstoragenetwork.org) in the coming months. Only the brainlife administrator is authorized to access these storage systems, however, administrators of these storage systems may have access to the data.

brainlife.io provides their users several *shared* computing resources including brainlife.io's own slurm clusters running on Jetstream, and various other [ACCESS](https://access-ci.org/) resources. These shared resources are enabled to all users by default, and when you submit jobs on brainlife, the data must be transferred to these remote computing resources. The data transfer between resources is encrypted by ssh/sha2 protocol with ssh keys encrypted by PBKDF2/sha512 algorithm.

The staged data and any data derivatives generated by Apps may be persisted up to 30 days (or shorter) on remote resources during which the administrators of those resources may have access to the data. All shared resources uses a single login account ("brlife") and only the brainlife service (amaretti) and the platform administrators have access to this account. brainlife platform then allows authorized users access to the data that belongs to the projects.

For monitoring and auditing information, please see "General Security" below.
### Metadata

brainlife.io will not use user's data to conduct any research activities unless you explicitly give permission to do so, however, we retains the right to collect "metadata" from brainlife.io users, including platform usage, number of contributions to the platform, and apps executed will be used to provide platform functionalities and to advance reproducible neuroscience research. We may also share this metadata anonymously and securely with our partners and collaborators in order to improve the platform functionality and user experience. Data collected from users will be ongoing, as long as you are registered for or actively using the platform.
