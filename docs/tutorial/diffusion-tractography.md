## Diffusion-weighted MRI preprocessing.

This page demonstrates common steps used to perform diffusion tractography analyses on brainlife.io. The goal of this tutorial is to show you how to process anatomical and diffusion data to [generate tractograms](https://brainlife.io/app/5aac2437f0b5260027e24ae1), [segment white matter tracts](https://brainlife.io/app/5cc73ef44ed9df00317f6288), and [map microstructural measures](https://brainlife.io/app/5cc210ce4ed9df00317f61cf) for the major white matter tracks.

This tutorial will use a combination of skills developed in the [Introduction tutorial](https://brainlife.io/docs/tutorial/introduction-to-brainlife/), the [Anatomical Preprocessing tutorial](https://brainlife.io/docs/tutorial/t1w-preprocessing/), and the [Diffusion MRI Preprocessing tutorial](https://brainlife.io/docs/tutorial/diffusion-preprocessing/) you recently completed. If you haven't read our introduction to brainlife, or if you're not comfortable staging, processing, archiving, and viewing data on brainlife.io, please go back through that tutorial before beginning this one.

### 1. Anatomical preprocessing.

The first step of diffusion tractography often involves processing the anatomical images. To track in a biologically-informed manner, and to extract major white matter tracts, we must have both anatomical (T1w or T2w) images and diffusion MRI images **aligned**. One way we can make this easier for [QSIPrep](https://brainlife.io/app/5dc1c2e57f55b85a93bd3021) is by aligning the anatomical images so that the center of the brain is centered in the image. We refer to this as **ACPC-aligned**, as we are aligning the data to the **anterior commissure-posterior comissure plane**. This is the first step in dMRI preprocessing, and it is typically done with the [FSL Anat (T1)](https://brainlife.io/app/5e3c87ae9362b7166cf9c7f4) app. We will then need to generate cortical and white matter surfaces and brain region parcellations using [Freesurfer](https://brainlife.io/app/5fe1056057aacd480f2f8e48). These will be used for segmenting the major white matter tracts following tractography. Once we've processed our anatomical image, we can move on to diffusion MRI preprocessing.

### 2. Diffusion preprocessing

The next step in diffusion preprocessing is to actually preprocess the diffusion data. dMRI data, like any other MRI dataset, is quite noisy. Just like fMRI, dMRI data is sensitive to **susceptibility distortions**. This is when regions of the brain look "wavy" or fold inward or outward on itself in images. This is due to how the scanner sweeps across the entire brain during acquisition. Also, dMRI data is very susceptible to motion. Because some scans take a long time, it is nearly impossible for a participant to lie completely motionless. Even the most subtle movements can alter the results in a specific region and make your data less accurate. Finally, movement of the magnetic gradients can induce electromagnetic currents which can affect the measurement in any given location. These electromagnetic currents are called **eddy currents**, and they are due to the fact that electricity and magnetism are part of the same field, otherwise known as the **electromagnetic field**. Thankfully, brainlife.io allows us to correct for all of these common artifacts using [QSIPrep](https://brainlife.io/app/5dc1c2e57f55b85a93bd3021).

In addition to these artifacts, dMRI has a very low **signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)**, which directly impacts how well you can fit microstructural models and analyze diffusion data. This means that in any given location, the amount of diffusion signal is very low compared to the "noise" of the scanner. There are methods to lower the amount of noise across the brain and thus increase the SNR. [QSIPrep](https://brainlife.io/app/5dc1c2e57f55b85a93bd3021) has the capability to identify and remove noise using principal components analysis (PCA) and Rician analysis.

On top of these issues, dMRI data is sensitive to other artifacts and non-regularities, including **gibbs ringing and bias field inhomogeneities**, which can affect the quality of the data and how well measures can be derived from the data. [QSIPrep](https://brainlife.io/app/5dc1c2e57f55b85a93bd3021) can deal with all of these issues for us!

Finally, once the dMRI data is preprocessed and cleaned, [QSIPrep](https://brainlife.io/app/5dc1c2e57f55b85a93bd3021) will align the dMRI data to the anatomical data. This will ensure that any analyses we do with the dMRI data will be anatomically-informed and biologically-relevant.

Useful information about the [QSIPrep](https://brainlife.io/app/5dc1c2e57f55b85a93bd3021) preprocessing pipeline can be found in this [original Nature Methods paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01185-5).

### 3. Diffusion modeling & anatomically-informed tractography.

Once the dMRI data has been cleaned and aligned to the anatomical (T1w) image, the next step is to map the underlying white matter anatomy using diffusion tractography. Diffusion tractography works by modeling how water is moving throughout the brain based on the principle of **anisotropy** -- that water will move unequally in a particular direction given a physical constraint. In the case of diffusion MRI, this constraint comes from the myelin wrapping the many axons arranged into bundles known as **fascicles**. Diffusion tractography generates **streamlines** that act as evidence of underlying white matter organization. We can bundle these streamlines into common white matter tracts digitally, just as we can bundle fascicles into **tracts** using histological methods.

The first step is to fit models of diffusion at each location in the dMRI image that can be used as a guide for the tractography algorithms. The most popular model for this is known as **constrained spherical deconvolution**, or **CSD**. CSD allows for the possibility of multiple fascicles entering a single location that may have different trajectories, which is a major advantage of this model over other models of diffusion. The CSD model at each location can tell the tracking algorithm _how strongly_ and in _what direction_ water is diffusing in the brain, and thus where organized and myelinated white matter is likely to be.

Once we know the direction of water movement using the CSD model, we can then perform **diffusion tractography** to map the underlying organized white matter. Diffusion tractography *sews* together regions with common directions of water movement into streamlines that provide evidence for organized, myelinated white matter. These operations can be done millions of times across the entire brain to form **tractograms**. There are many algorithms for doing this that fall into two main categories: **deterministic** and **probabilistic**. **Deterministic** algorithms work by strictly following the directions of water movement, while **probabilistic** algorithms infer a probability of different directions of water movement at any given location. Deterministic tractography tends to be an overly conservative representation of the white matter, as modeling is never perfectly accurate. Probabilistic tractography tends to provide *hairy* streamline representations, as the model allows for a probability of different directions of water movement at any given location. Recently, it was discovered that combining both algorithms, or **ensembling** them, provides the most anatomically-accurate tractograms.

On brainlife.io, we have many options for performing tractography! For this tutorial, we will focus on anatomically-constrained tractography, using the [mrtrix3 - WMC Anatomically Constrained Tractography (ACT)](https://brainlife.io/app/5e9dced9f1745d6994f692c0) app, which restricts streamline representations to those that are biologically-plausible (i.e. not crossing CSF or gray matter)! Within this app, both the CSD and DTI models will be fit to the diffusion data and returned as outputs!

More information on ensemble tractography can be found in this [PLOS Computational Biology article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004692) paper. More information on **ACT** can be found in this [Neuroimage publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22705374).

### 4. Major white matter tract segmentation.

Once our anatomical brain parcellations and whole-brain tractograms are generated, the next step is to segment the tractogram into known **major white matter tracts**. To do this, we need both information about the terminations of each streamline into the cortex and histologically-derived definitions for each major white matter tract. The histological definitions of major white matter tracts allow us to group the streamlines in our tractograms into major white matter tracts. On brainlife.io, we have developed an automated [white matter segmentation](https://brainlife.io/app/5cc73ef44ed9df00317f6288) app that will segment our whole-brain tractograms into 61 known major white matter tracts.

Following segmentation, it is common practice to remove outlier streamlines based on their distance away from the 'core' of the tract. On brainlife.io, we have developed an automated [remove outliers](https://brainlife.io/app/5cc9eca04b5e4502275edba6) app that will remove outlier streamlines based on their distance away from the center of the 'core' of the tract.

More information on the segmentation algorithm can be found in this [Brain Structure and Function paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31342157).

### 5. Macro-and-Microstructural statistics of major white matter tracts.

Once we have segmented our tractograms into major white matter tracts and fit the DTI model to our dMRI data, we can now compute macrostructural (i.e. volume, length, streamline count) statistics of each tract and map the microstructural information to our major white matter tracts. For microstructural mapping, this is done by computing the average microstructural measure at multiple locations along each major white matter tract. This process generates a plot known as a **tract profile**, which provides microstructural information at different locations along a tract. These profiles can be used to examine microstructural properties along different tracts that might help distinguish different groups, such as those with a neurodegenerative disease versus those without the disease. We have developed an automated [microstructural mapping](https://brainlife.io/app/5ed02b780a8ed88a57482c92) app on brainlife.io that will map multiple microstructural measures. To compute macrostructural statistics, we have developed an automated [macrostructural statistics](https://brainlife.io/app/5cc9c6b44b5e4502275edb4b) app on brainlife that will compute multiple macrostructural measures.

More information on **tract profiles** can be found in this [PLOS One article](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049790).
