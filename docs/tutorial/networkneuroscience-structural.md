## Structural connectivity.

Let's start by learning a little bit about **structural connectivity.** Diffusion MRI measures how **anisotropic** the movement of water is, with the basic principle that myelinated tissue will create more anisotropic water movement. **Structural connectivity** is one type of analysis that describes the structural organization of the white matter using diffusion MRI data. This type of analysis characterizes how connected different regions are by computing the number of **diffusion tractography streamlines** that terminate into a particular region. The rationale is that regions that have greater density of streamline terminations have greater connectivity with the regions where those streamlines also terminate. These density values are stored in what is known as a connectivity matrix. Each position in the matrix represents the connectivity between two particular regions.

From these matrices, scientists can then examine properties that describe the inter-relatedness of many regions. These properties can be used to identify **network-level**, inter-individual differences in a large cohort.

This page demonstrates how to generate structural connectivity matrices on brainlife.io. The goal of this tutorial is to show you how to generate structural connectivity matrices following dMRI preprocessing and tractography. This tutorial will be using [Multi-atlas Transfer Tool (MaTT)](https://brainlife.io/app/6016dcdc321a4aafce6decd5) to map the Glasser 180-node cortical atlas to the preprocessed Freesurfer surfaces, [anatomically-constrained tractography](https://brainlife.io/app/5e9dced9f1745d6994f692c0) to generate whole-brain tractograms, and [network matrices](https://brainlife.io/app/626840bbf3858674a29fe791) to compute the connectivity between each region in the atlas.

This tutorial will use a combination of skills developed in the [Introduction tutorial](https://brainlife.io/docs/tutorial/introduction-to-brainlife/) and presumes that you have data processed using [dMRI Preprocessing](https://brainlife.io/docs/tutorial/diffusion-preprocessing/) and [diffusion tractography](https://brainlife.io/docs/tutorial/diffusion-tractography/). If you are not comfortable archiving, staging, and running apps on brainlife.io, please go back through the introduction tutorial before beginning this one.

### 1. Anatomical preprocessing.

The first step of structural network generation often involves processing the anatomical images. In order to guarantee that any generalizations regarding location made from the preprocessed diffusion data is anatomically-informed, we must have both of our anatomical (T1w or T2w) images and our diffusion MRI images **aligned**. One way we can make this easier for [MRTrix3 Preprocessing](https://brainlife.io/app/5a813e52dc4031003b8b36f9) is by aligning the anatomical images in such a way that the center of the brain is centered in the image. We refer to this as **ACPC-aligned**, as we are aligning the data to the **anterior commissure-posterior comissure plane**. This is the first step in dMRI preprocessing, and is typically done with the [FSL Anat (T1w)](https://brainlife.io/app/5e3c87ae9362b7166cf9c7f4) app. In order to map the Glasser 180-node atlas using the [Multi-atlas Transfer Tool (MaTT)](https://brainlife.io/app/6016dcdc321a4aafce6decd5) and compute the streamline density between each region, we first need to generate cortical and white matter surfaces and brain region parcellations using [Freesurfer](https://brainlife.io/app/5fe1056057aacd480f2f8e48). Once our anatomical image is aligned, our surfaces are generated, and the Glasser 180-node cortical atlas is mapped, we can move on to diffusion preprocessing.

### 2. Diffusion preprocessing

The next step in diffusion preprocessing is to actually preprocess the diffusion data. dMRI data, like any other MRI dataset, is quite noisy. Just like fMRI, dMRI data is sensitive to **susceptibility distortions**. This is when regions of the brain look "wavy" or fold inward or outward on itself in images. This is due to how the scanner sweeps across the entire brain during acquisition. Also, dMRI data is very susceptible to **motion**. Because some scans take a long time, it is nearly impossible for a participant to lie completely motionless. Even the most subtle movements can alter the results in a specific region and make your data less accurate. Finally, movement of the magnetic gradients can induce electromagnetic currents which can affect the measurement in any given location. These electromagnetic currents are called **eddy currents**, and they are due to the fact that electricity and magnetism are part of the same field, otherwise known as an **electromagnetic field**. Thankfully, we can use brainlife.io to correct for all of these common artifacts using [MRTrix3 Preprocessing](https://brainlife.io/app/5a813e52dc4031003b8b36f9).

In addition to these artifacts, dMRI has very low **signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)**, which directly impacts how well you can fit microstructural models and analyze diffusion data. This means that in any given location, the amount of diffusion signal is very low compared to the "noise" of the scanner. There are methods to lower the amount of noise across the brain, and thus increase the SNR. [MRTrix3 Preprocessing](https://brainlife.io/app/5a813e52dc4031003b8b36f9) has the capability to identify and remove noise using principal components analysis (PCA) and Rician analysis.

On top of these issues, dMRI data is sensitive to other artifacts and non-regularities, including **gibbs ringing and bias field inhomogeneities**, which can affect the quality of the data and how well measures can be derived from the data. [MRTrix3 Preprocessing](https://brainlife.io/app/5a813e52dc4031003b8b36f9) can deal with all of these issues for us!

Finally, once the dMRI data is preprocessed and cleaned, [MRTrix3 Preprocessing](https://brainlife.io/app/5a813e52dc4031003b8b36f9) will align the dMRI data to the anatomical data. This will ensure that any analyses we do with the dMRI data will be anatomically-informed and biologically-relevant.

Useful information about the preprocessing pipeline that [MRTrix3 Preprocessing](https://brainlife.io/app/5a813e52dc4031003b8b36f9) is designed to run -- Diffusion Parameter EStimation with Gibbs and NoisE Removal (DESIGNER) -- can be found in this [original Neuroimage paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30077743).

### 3. Diffusion modeling & anatomically-informed tractography.

Once the dMRI data has been cleaned and aligned to the anatomical (T1w) image, the next step is to map the underlying white matter anatomy using diffusion tractography. Diffusion tractography works by modeling how water is moving throughout the brain based on the principle of **anisotropy** -- that water will move unequally in a particular direction given a physical constraint. In the case of diffusion MRI, this constraint comes from the myelin wrapping the many axons arranged into bundles known as **fascicles**. Diffusion tractography generates **streamlines** that act as evidence of underlying white matter organization. We can bundle these streamlines into common white matter tracts digitally, just as we can bundle fascicles into **tracts** using histological methods.

The first step is to fit models of diffusion at each location in the dMRI image that can be used as a guide for the tractography algorithms. The most popular model for this is known as **constrained spherical deconvolution**, or **CSD**. CSD allows for the possibility of multiple fascicles entering a single location that may have different trajectories, which is a major advantage of this model over other models of diffusion. The CSD model at each location can tell the tracking algorithm _how strongly_ and in _what direction_ water is diffusing in the brain, and thus where organized and myelinated white matter is likely to be.

Once we know the direction of water movement using the CSD model, we can then perform **diffusion tractography** to map the underlying organized white matter. Diffusion tractography *sews* together regions with common directions of water movement into streamlines that provide evidence for organized, myelinated white matter. These operations can be done millions of times across the entire brain to form **tractograms**. There are many algorithms for doing this that fall into two main categories: **deterministic** and **probabilistic**. **Deterministic** algorithms work by strictly following the directions of water movement, while **probabilistic** algorithms infer a probability of different directions of water movement at any given location. Deterministic tractography tends to be an overly conservative representation of the white matter, as modeling is never perfectly accurate. Probabilistic tractography tends to provide *hairy* streamline representations, as the model allows for a probability of different directions of water movement at any given location. Recently, it was discovered that combining both algorithms, or **ensembling** them, provides the most anatomically-accurate tractograms.

On brainlife.io, we have many options for performing tractography! For this tutorial, we will focus on Probabilistic tractography, using the [mrtrix3 - WMC Anatomically Constrained Tractography (ACT) ](https://brainlife.io/app/5e9dced9f1745d6994f692c0) app, which restricts streamline representations to those that are biologically-plausible (i.e. not crossing CSF or gray matter)! Within this app, both the CSD and DTI models will be fit to the diffusion data and returned as outputs!

More information on ensemble tractography can be found in this [PLOS Computational Biology article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004692) paper. More information on **ACT** can be found in this [Neuroimage publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22705374).

### 4. Generate structural connectivity matrices.

Once the whole-brain tractograms have been generated, we can now compute the streamline density between each region and generate our **structural connectivity matrices**. These matrices can then be used to derive **network-related** measures of the white matter organization of an individual or of common properties amongst groups. For this tutorial, we will use [network matrices](https://brainlife.io/app/626840bbf3858674a29fe791) to generate our structural connectivity matrix.
